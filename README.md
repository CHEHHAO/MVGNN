# MVGNN

This repository contains the source code for our Graph Neural Network (GNN) paper. It provides implementations of the proposed methods, experiments, and evaluation metrics used in the paper.

## Overview

This project implements a novel graph neural network architecture for [brief description of the problem, e.g., "node classification", "graph classification", "link prediction", etc.]. The code is structured to allow easy reproduction of our experimental results and to facilitate further research in graph-based learning.
